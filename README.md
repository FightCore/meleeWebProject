# Melee Framedata Database

*Melee Frame Data* is a web application inspired by [Ultimate Frame Data](https://ultimateframedata.com/) to give players easy and convenient access to gameplay data that is otherwise not readily avaliable. The database utilizes Flask as the webframe for the main Python program, which uses SQLAlchemy to store the data for each character. 

## To Do
* Most characters still have blank data fields that need to be filled

* Add character stats such as dash duration, rankings for misc info (if you have any suggestions feel free to direct message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SandTFGC)

* Find missing character animation GIFs, such as all of Pichu's animations and most character's throws

* Clean up the "Attacks" data table by seperating attacks among ground normals, aerials, grounded specials, and aerial specials

* Toggle some more information off if it does not apply to that character/specific move (such as how multi jabs are by default not shown unless inserted in the data table)

* Clean up the CSS on the home page and character pages (some containers not fitting to page correctly)

* Find a way to not have to prompt the user to select mobile/desktop

* Add general info icon on home page, explaining terminology used on the website and give credit to all who datamined the game to obtain the frame data

* Lauch the website
